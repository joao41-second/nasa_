*Explore the universe through an interactive, gamified experience.*

## Overview

Our team developed an interactive application designed to revolutionize how people explore and understand NASAâ€™s vast collection of space datasets. The app provides an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate through data using a consistent system of **Universal Space Coordinates**, visualizing information across the Milky Way and beyond.  

By integrating multiple NASA datasets into a unified, visually rich environment, users can seamlessly discover celestial objects, compare scientific parameters, and grasp complex astronomical relationships.

## Features

- **Unified Data Visualization**: Explore multiple NASA datasets in a single interactive platform.  
- **Universal Space Coordinates**: Navigate the galaxy with a consistent reference system.  
- **Gamified Exploration**: Earn achievements, complete challenges, and participate in educational missions.  
- **Interactive Learning**: Turn passive observation into active engagement with space science.  
- **Open Science & Education**: Make NASAâ€™s data accessible to students, researchers, and the general public.
